# pdfocr-batch
Batch process a directory of plain PDFs, to PDFs with OCR layer.

Works on Linux Mint. Requires packages pdftk, convert (from imagemagick) and tesseract to be installed first.

Place in a directory of PDFs, make executable, and run with ./pdfocr-batch.sh command.

(Temporary directories of intermediate pdf and png files are left in place presently while in development. Delete these directories once happy with finished PDF files)
